Last weekend, I participated in an awesome program called Design Your Personal Legend. Itâ€™s the brainchild of Annie. It was such an amazing experience and the organizers, @Ingenius, and the trainers deserve all the credit. Thank you Annie, Jonathan Quek, Candice Lee, Tan Lionel and all the participants for making it an awesome experience for me. 

Every session forces you to challenge your perceptions and unlearn. Every activity is meant to push you off your comfort zone. 

It is a reminder that to do things that matter, you have to push your limits, take a leap of faith and just do it because you will never feel 100% ready. 

I have taken up a 30-day challenge to kickstart my dream to be a changemaker. Look out for my 10 interesting postings in the next 30-days!
