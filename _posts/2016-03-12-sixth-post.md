Last Saturday, we were at Thana’s place for potluck. Everyone was supposed to bring something they cooked over. When I reached, I saw satay, which Thana bought. Moon ordered pizza delivery. I brought packet drinks. The only one who cooked was Mazu. She made pasta salad. Mazu called once as she was lost on the way there. Later, she called again. She was lost in the lift. 

So Thana was sharing about her weight loss regime and her diet plan. This meal doesn’t count, she said. She said that if she successfully lose weight, she would love to go around, give talks and inspire others to do the same. So this is a big deal to her. It is a big deal to many people. 

Every year, half the population makes new year resolutions. For most people, their new year resolutions fall into a variation of these categories:
 
Lose Weight and Get Fit
Quit Smoking
Learn Something New
Eat Healthier and Diet
Get Out of Debt and Save Money
Spend More Time with Family
Travel to New Places
Be Less Stressed
Volunteer
Drink Less

I guess we are more similar with one another than we think. According to a study, over 88% of new year resolutions fail. Why are we so bad at keeping new year resolutions? Is it because we are lazy? That we lack the drive? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
