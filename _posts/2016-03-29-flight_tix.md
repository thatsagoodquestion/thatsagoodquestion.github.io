I was spending hours online trying to get the best flight deal for my backpacking trip to the states. Maybe too much time. I should formulate a strategy. First draft of strategy:
* Subscribe to as many airlines as you can - For example, AirAsia(AA) will announce it’s zero fare sale through email. Update your account and credit card details so during the sale, the purchase is quicker. I also hold the AA BIG Prepaid MasterCard credit card so I get access to the 24-hr priority sale. 
* Keep your searches top secret - Search for flights in incognito mode. Based on cookies in your browser, flight prices do increase in prices as the site wants to scare you into booking the flight quickly before prices get higher. 
* Use AirFare Watchdog - I use AirFare Watchdog to monitor flights I am interested in and alert me when there is a good deal 
* Use Hopper Flights - This tip is courtesy of Gwen Yi. She suggested I download this mobile app. It will advise you if you should buy your flight tickets now or later with its price prediction algorithms. One caveat, it doesn’t support multi-city yet.
* Best days to fly - Needless to say, they are unpopular travel days. It’s usually Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Expensive days are usually Fridays and Sundays. Use Skyscanner to verify if prices are indeed lower with actual travel dates.
* Use Skyscanner - After choosing your destination, when selecting travel dates, Skyscanner has an option for selecting the whole month to get dates with the cheapest price. Or select the cheapest month. Now that you have identified the cheapest range of travel dates, let’s use that in Google Flights.
* Use Google Flights - Love this site. Using the dates from Skyscanner, you can input your destination and dates. Especially for multi-city trips, it’s easy to tweak travel dates (+- a few days) and see the price changes. They also provide tips on how you can save money if you were to travel a day later/earlier. You can watch a flight by saving it and be alerted when price changes. It also has an explore map option that allows you to check flight prices to destinations around the world.
* Use Yapta - So you are happy with the price and finally bought your flight tickets. Subscribe to Yapta and track the flights that you have bought. It allows you to get a refund if your flight’s price dipped in the future
* Subscribe to the frequent flier program - I have gotten free return tickets to London from my Enrich points. I redeemed them when there is a 50% discount on enrich points flight redemption. I do the same with my AA Big points. Recently redeemed free return tickets to Langkawi and Singapore.
What other tips do you have for getting the best flight deals?
