Thank you so much for your thoughts on why resolutions fail. CJ, Meera and Jamie mentioned that it is likely we set goals without truly being prepared to do anything to achieve it. Jason recommends that we should just do it instead of overthinking it. Leonard recommends incorporating a rewards/penalty system and taking a serious bet with a friend. If I have to give 25% of my salary to my friend for not achieving my goal, I think I would achieve my goal too. Haha. Jamie thinks we should just go out and make the best out of every situation without any regrets. Jo-Ee sets small achievable plans so it makes her happy as she achieves them. 

As I read your responses, I did some research online as well on studies conducted related to human behaviours. They are not far off from the responses I received. According to Amy Cuddy, a social psychologist and Harvard Business School professor, these resolutions could actually be doing more harm than good. We're setting ourselves up for failure and failure isn't a very good motivator.

We tend to set unreasonable aims for ourselves, she explained, and then experience negative emotions and a lack of motivation when we don't reach them. Failing to meet the unreasonable goals we set for ourselves can in turn take a negative toll on our self-worth. Part of the problem is that we frame our resolutions in absolutes, according to Cuddy.

So what happens when you do fail to meet a goal, and you need to get back on your feet? "Recognize that failure distorts your perceptions about the task itself and about your capacities. Don’t ‘buy’ that you are incapable," Psychologist Guy Winch writes in Psychology Today. "Adopt a mindset of persistence and optimism."

Having said that, is there any hope left for setting goals? Ramit Sethi and BJ Fogg, who runs Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford offer some tips below.

1. Ride the motivational wave - “Motivational waves” moments are when we feel really inspired to take action. Remember the last time you cleared your entire to-do list? That’s a motivational wave. So the next time you feel motivated, list everything you need in order to achieve the goal. Then sketch a rough outline of a fail-proof system that will help you follow through. For example, my goal might be to exercise regularly at the gym. So the next time I feel motivated, I would build a system. I would put out my gym clothes and shoes so it is visible whenever I enter the room. When I am back from work, it would stare at me. Chances are, I will work out. A system is supposed to eliminate obstacles and excuses for you to achieve your goal.
2. Start small and go big later - Like what Jo-Ee said, start with small baby steps. For exercising, it can be to start with five pushups. Willpower is like muscle. The more you work on it, the stronger it becomes. Willpower is actually very much like the fuel meter in your car. It can deplete and it needs to be re-charged. I’ll explore that in the next post. 
3. Put it on your calendar - Decide ahead of time and map out your schedule for the week. Put your baby steps goals into your calendar. Then, set an alert in your calendar or on your phone to review this every week.

I’d like to challenge you to try the three tips out for just one goal. My goal will be to exercise more. Let me know it goes.
